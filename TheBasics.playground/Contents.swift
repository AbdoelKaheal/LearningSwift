//declaring Variables

var name = "Abdoelsamea" //Variable
let lastName = "Kaheal" //Constant

//Declaring Variables on multipile lines

var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0 //use Commas to declare multiple values

//USE VARIABLES ONLY FOR STORING VALUES THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED ELSE USE CONSTANTS

//Type annotation
//Types can always be inferered by the complier so you don't need to specify

var welcomeMessage: String // Declare a var called welcomeMessage of Type String (Will only store strings)


var red, green, blue: String //In this case they are all strings

var yellow = "The color yellow", orange = "the color orange" //Checks out  as well ;)

print(orange)

//naming variables and constants

let ðŸ˜€ = "Emoji face ;)" //Perfectly fine with swift

let `let` = "Very cool huh?" //Use backticks (`) when you NEED to use a reserved keyword as a name ;)

print(`let`) //again when you need to call it use bacticks



//Printing constants and variables

//print(_: separator: terminator:) -> We will have a look at this in a the functions chapter so don't worry too much about it ;)))


//for example

print("Hello", terminator:" put here things like a line break woohoo") //Use of terminator :)



// Semicolons are not required unless on the same line code ie

let realName = "Abdoelsamea kaheal"; print("is so cool")//


//INT -> 34 -23 12 99990 123121 0

// Important to note -------- Type inference

/*
 Swift uses type inference to determine types if not defined. if you dont define a float
 such as
 let b:Float = 42.12312 than it will think it is a Double type
 */

let numericLiterals = 0x11 //can be anything from hex, binary, octal, and plain (decimal(17 etc))

let bigNumber = 1.25e12 //totally fine with swift


//Amazing things that you should know in swift :)))))))


let paddedDouble = 000123.456 //again here it is a float but swift inferces it as a double :OOOO

let oneMillion = 1_000_000 //all of this is for readiabllity and does not acctually change how the number behaves

print(oneMillion) //should print out 1 million

let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1 //same thing here

let stringToNumber = Int("12")

print(stringToNumber)


let three = 3

let pointOneFourOneFiveNine = 0.14159

let pi = Double(three) + pointOneFourOneFiveNine //YOU MUST Convert to a double in order to add





let integerPi = Int(pi) //truncated down to 3

let doubleNum = 3.999999

let intDoubleNum = Int(doubleNum) // truncated down to 3 and not rounded up to 4 NOTE

//type aliases basically allows you to rename types ;)

//for example -
typealias AudioSample = UInt16 //here were renaming UInt16 to be AudioSample

let uint16Number: AudioSample = AudioSample.max //use it like  you would use UInt16 and max just gets the highest value it can hold

print(uint16Number)
